## 👋 About Me

Hi there,

I'm a builder who works at the intersection of AI and real industries. I don't build demos — I build production systems that solve real problems for real people.

I've shipped an AI credit dispute platform serving **30K+ users** ([CreditCareAI](https://www.ccareai.com)), an AI-powered operations system processing **10K+ emails/day** ([SoFloCleans](https://www.soflocleans.net)), and helped create a financial literacy game that reached **5M+ downloads** in **7K+ classrooms** ([Fintropolis](https://www.allyfintropolis.com/)).

Currently focused on **ML/LLMOps** — taking models from notebooks to production with proper training pipelines, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Studying the full stack: from fine-tuning vision-language models to building end-to-end MLOps pipelines.

When I'm not building: growing rare mango varieties in South Florida, playing golf, and listening to jazz.
