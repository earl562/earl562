## About Me

Hi there,

I'm a builder who works at the intersection of AI and real industries. I don't build demos — I build production systems that solve real problems for real people.

I've built an AI credit dispute platform serving 30K+ users, an AI-powered operations system processing 10K+ emails/day, and helped create a financial literacy game that reached 5M+ downloads in 7K+ classrooms.

Currently focused on ML/LLMOps — taking models from notebooks to production with proper training pipelines, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. I'm studying the full stack: from fine-tuning vision-language models to building end-to-end MLOps pipelines.

When I'm not building: growing rare mango varieties in South Florida, playing golf, and listening to jazz.

## What I've Built

- [CreditCareAI](https://www.ccareai.com) — AI credit dispute platform, 30K+ users, Python/FastAPI, Next.js, Groq AI
- [SoFloCleans](https://www.soflocleans.net) — AI-powered email orchestration, Claude Sonnet, HubSpot CRM, 10K+ emails/day
- [Fintropolis](https://www.ally.com/fintropolis/) — Financial literacy game in Minecraft at Ally Financial, 5M+ downloads

## Currently Building

- [MangoAI](https://github.com/earl562/mangoai) — Fine-tuning Qwen3-VL-8B with QLoRA to identify Florida mango varieties from leaf photos. Full MLOps lifecycle with MLflow, SGLang, and FastAPI.
- [PlotLot](https://github.com/earl562/PlotLot) — AI-powered real estate zoning analysis agent with LlamaIndex, Pinecone, and OpenAI
