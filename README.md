## 👋 About Me

Hi there,

I'm a builder. I find problems in industries I'm in and use AI to solve them.

- 🧹 Built [SoFloCleans](https://www.soflocleans.net) — AI-powered ops processing 10K+ emails/day
- 🎮 Built [Fintropolis](https://www.allyfintropolis.com/) at Ally Financial — 5M+ downloads, 7K classrooms
- 🧠 Currently focused on ML/LLMOps — training pipelines, evaluation, deployment, monitoring
- 🥭 Growing rare mango varieties in South Florida
- ⛳ Golf and jazz when I'm not building
