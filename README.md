### Hi, I'm Earl Perry

I find problems in industries I'm in — then I build AI to fix them.

- Building [MangoAI](https://github.com/earl562/mangoai) — fine-tuning a vision-language model to identify Florida mango varieties from leaf photos
- Building [PlotLot](https://github.com/earl562/PlotLot) — AI agent that analyzes zoning codes and property feasibility for real estate developers
- Working on [Hadza Translation](https://github.com/earl562/Hadza_Translation) — preserving an endangered click language spoken by ~1,000 people in Tanzania
- Curating datasets on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/earl562) — 9.2k+ views on mango varieties, 27 likes on Hadza translation data
- Studying ML/LLMOps end-to-end — from training and evaluation to deployment and monitoring
