### Hi, I'm Earl Perry

I find niche problems and build production AI systems to solve them.

- Built [CreditCareAI](https://www.ccareai.com) — AI credit dispute platform serving 30K+ users
- Built [SoFloCleans](https://www.soflocleans.net) — AI-powered operations processing 10K+ emails/day
- Built [Fintropolis](https://www.ally.com/fintropolis/) at Ally Financial — financial literacy game in Minecraft, 7K classrooms, 5M+ downloads
- Previously Data QA Engineer & Data Analyst at Ally Financial
- FAMU alum — B.S. Quantitative Analysis
- Currently building ML/LLMOps systems end-to-end and documenting the process

When I'm not building: growing rare mango varieties in South Florida, playing golf, and listening to jazz.
